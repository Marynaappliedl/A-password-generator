# Password Generator

This is a simple password generator web application that allows users to customize and generate secure passwords based on their preferences.

## Features

- Generate passwords with a specified length. In the project I use the length between 8 and 128 characters.
- Choose character types to include in the password (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, special characters). At least one of them
- Validate user inputs to ensure a secure and customizable password.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

2. The Password Generator page will be displayed.

3. Click the "Generate Password" button to start the password generation process.

4. You will be prompted to provide the following information:
   - Length of the password (between 8 and 128 characters).
   - Select character types to include (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, special characters).
   If a criteria is not satisfied, you, as a user will see a prompt why it has not worked and you will need to restart the process, using the prompt/prompts if both of the conditions aren`t met

5. After providing the information, the generated password will be displayed in the textarea.

6. You can copy the generated password for your use using Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V combinations.
